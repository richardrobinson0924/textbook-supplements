\section{Interest Rates}

\textsc{The dimension} for an interest rate $i$ is $c_1/c_2/T$ where $c$ is a currency and $T$ is the interest period. If an amount $P$ is borrowed for $N$ periods at $i$, the final amount is \begin{equation}
  F = P(1+i)^N = P(1+i_s)^m = P + I_c
\end{equation}
which is known as compounding where the total interest on such loan $I_c$ is the compound interest. Consequently, the simple interest $I_s = PiN$ is such interest not compounded.

\bigskip
\marginnote{For example, a NIR of $i$ / year compounded monthly is $i/12$ per month.}
The \textit{nominal interest rate} (NIR) is the conventional annual interest rate. Suppose a period is divided by $m$. If $r$ is the NIR for the full period, the interest rate is
\begin{equation}
  i_s = r/m \iff r = i_s m
\end{equation}
The \textit{effective interest rate} is the actual interest rate given by \begin{equation}
  i_e = \frac{F}{P} - 1 = \left( 1 + \frac{r}{m} \right)^m - 1 \;\sim e^r - 1
\end{equation}

A cash flow diagram is a visualization of cash flows and interest over time. Note that $N$ years from time $t$ is the end of period $N$ and beginning of $N+1$.
